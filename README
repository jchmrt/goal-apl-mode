                   -------------------------------
                     GOAL APL Mode for GNU Emacs
                   -------------------------------

GOAL is an agent-oriented programming language which can be used to
write multi-agent systems for solving problems in an environment [1].
It's main development environment is based on Eclipse, which is
lacking in both customizability and parentheses ;), so this major mode
provides simple syntax highlighting for GOAL files to improve the
writing and reading of GOAL code in GNU Emacs. To see an example of
how it looks, view the example.png file.

                               FEATURES

GOAL APL Mode currently features syntax highlighting and the ability
to highlight occurences of the same variable as the one at the current
point in the same GOAL statement. This is useful for quickly spotting
typos and understanding how the variable is bound in that statement.



                                USAGE

To use this major mode, simply download the goal-apl-mode.el file and
put it somewhere it will be loaded. For example put it in
~/.emacs.d/lisp and then add a line like the following to your init
file (e.g. ~/.emacs):

    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp")

Next up require the goal-apl-mode in your init file:

    (require 'goal-apl-mode)

The mode will now be loaded whenever you open any GOAL files, and
you'll be able to enjoy syntax highlighting on all your code! By
default highlighting occurences of the variable at the point is turned
on, to turn it off simply:

    M-x customize-variable RET goal-apl-highlight-variable-p

or turn it off manually in your init file by adding the following
line:

    (setq goal-apl-highlight-variable-p nil)


                             LIMITATIONS

This mode is still very much a work in progress, for example it might
miss some syntax constructs and automatic indentation has not yet been
implemented.
